# Uncommon Dart Exception Handling: Timeout and Unexpected Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error handling pattern in Dart using `try-catch-finally` blocks. The code includes examples of handling specific exceptions like `TimeoutException` and generic `Exception` types, as well as handling unexpected errors that might not be caught by specific catch blocks.  The improved solution shows a more robust approach to exception handling.

## Bug Description

The initial code may not fully handle all potential errors or may not handle them in the most efficient order. The solution demonstrates more robust error handling.
